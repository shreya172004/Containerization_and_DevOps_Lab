##  Experiment 3
Deploying NGINX Web Server Using Official, Ubuntu, and Alpine Base Images and Comparing Image Layers

---

##  Aim

To deploy the NGINX web server using different Docker base images and compare their image size, performance, layers, and security impact.

---

##  Objectives

After completing this experiment, students will be able to:

- Deploy NGINX using Docker containers
- Build custom images using Dockerfile
- Understand Docker image layers
- Compare Ubuntu, Alpine, and Official images
- Analyze size, speed, and security differences
- Explain real-world uses of NGINX in containers

---

##  Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- Basic Linux commands
- Knowledge of:
  - docker pull
  - docker run
  - docker build
  - Dockerfile
  - Port mapping

---

#  Theory

## What is NGINX?

NGINX is a high-performance:

- Web Server
- Reverse Proxy
- Load Balancer
- API Gateway

It uses an **event-driven asynchronous architecture**, making it faster and more scalable than traditional servers like Apache.

---

## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that:

- Packages applications with dependencies
- Ensures portability
- Provides lightweight virtualization
- Speeds up deployment

---

## What are Docker Image Layers?

Docker images are built in layers.

Each instruction in Dockerfile creates a layer:

- FROM
- RUN
- COPY
- ADD

### Importance of Layers

- More layers → bigger image
- Bigger images → slower pull time
- Larger images → more vulnerabilities
- Fewer layers → faster and more secure

---

## Base Image Types

| Base Image | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Official nginx | Pre-built optimized production image |
| Ubuntu | Full Linux OS with tools |
| Alpine | Lightweight minimal Linux |

---

#  Experiment Procedure

---

#  Part 1 — Deploy NGINX Using Official Image

## Step 1: Pull Image

```bash
docker pull nginx:latest
```
![](PullImage.png)

## Step 2: Run Container

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx-official -p 8080:80 nginx
```
![](RunContainer.png)
## Step 3: Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```
![](Output.png)

OR open browser:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Observations

```bash
docker images nginx
```
![](SizeCheck1.png)
- Pre-optimized
- Minimal configuration
- Production ready
- Medium size (~140MB)

---

#  Part 2 — Custom NGINX Using Ubuntu Base Image

---

## Step 1: Create Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile`:
![](FolderCreationUbuntu.png)    
![](DockerFileCreation.png)  

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y nginx && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
![](Codefordockerfile.png)  

---

## Step 2: Build Image

```bash
docker build -t nginx-ubuntu .
```
![](BuildImage.png)  

---

## Step 3: Run Container

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx-ubuntu -p 8081:80 nginx-ubuntu
```
![](RunContainer2.png)  

---

## Observations

```bash
docker images nginx-ubuntu
```

- Large image (~220MB+)
- Many layers
- Includes full OS
- Slower startup
- Larger attack surface

![](SizeCheck2.png)  

---

#  Part 3 — Custom NGINX Using Alpine Base Image

---

## Step 1: Create Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add --no-cache nginx

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
![](AlpineFolderCreation.png)
![](CodeForAlpineDockerfile.png)

---

## Step 2: Build Image

```bash
docker build -t nginx-alpine .
```
![](BuildImageAlpine.png)  

---

## Step 3: Run Container

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx-alpine -p 8082:80 nginx-alpine
```
![](RunContainerAlpine.png)  

---

## Observations

```bash
docker images nginx-alpine
```
![](SizeCheckAlpine.png)   

- Very small (~25–30MB)
- Minimal dependencies
- Faster pull time
- Faster startup
- More secure

---

#  Part 4 — Compare Image Sizes

## Command

```bash
docker images | grep nginx
```
![](SizeComparison.png)

## Sample Output

| Image Type   | Size      |
|--------------|-----------|
| nginx:latest | ~140MB    |
| nginx-ubuntu | ~220MB+   |
| nginx-alpine | ~25MB     |

---

#  Part 5 — Inspect Image Layers

## Commands

```bash
docker history nginx
docker history nginx-ubuntu
docker history nginx-alpine
```

## Observations

- Ubuntu → many filesystem layers
- Alpine → minimal layers
- Official → optimized layers

---

#  Part 6 — Serve Custom HTML Page

## Step 1: Create HTML

```bash
mkdir html
echo "<h1>Hello from Docker NGINX</h1>" > html/index.html
```
![](htmlfolder.png)
![](htmlfilecode.png)

## Step 2: Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8083:80 \
  -v $(pwd)/html:/usr/share/nginx/html \
  nginx
```
![](ContainerwithVolumeMount.png)

## Step 3: Verify

Open:

```
http://localhost:8083
```
